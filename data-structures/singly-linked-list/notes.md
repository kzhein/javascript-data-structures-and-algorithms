## Comparisons with Arrays

**Lists**

- Connected via nodes with a next pointer
- Random access is not allowed

**Arrays**

- Indexed in order!
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive
- Can quickly be accessed at a specific index

## Big O of Singly Linked Lists

Insertion - O(1)

Removal - It depends... O(1) or O(n)

Searching - O(n)

Access - O(n)
