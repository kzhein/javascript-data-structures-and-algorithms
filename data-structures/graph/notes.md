## Graph

### Essential Graph Terms

- **Vertex** - a node
- **Edge** - connection between nodes
- **Weighted/Unweighted** - values assigned to distances between vertices
- **Directed/Undirected** - directions assigned to distanced between vertices

### Representing a Graph

| Adjacency List                            | Adjacency Matrix                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Can take up less space (in sparse graphs) | Takes up more space (in sparse graphs) |
| Faster to iterate over all edges          | Slower to iterate over all edges       |
| Can be slower to lookup specific edge     | Faster to lookup specific edge         |
